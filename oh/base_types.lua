The search is done as described in function package.searchpath.\nThe third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by the variable package.cpath. Again, the search is done as described in function package.searchpath. Once it finds a C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the library.

The name of this C function is the string \"luaopen_\" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is removed.\nThe fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for a library for the root name of the given module. If found, it looks into it for an open function for the submodule. With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its original open function.\nAll searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the file name where the module was found, as returned by package.searchpath.
